An administrator is trying to remove configurations from a switch. After using the command erase startup-config and reloading the switch, the administrator finds that VLANs 10 and 100 still exist on the switch. Why were these VLANs not removed?
These VLANs are default VLANs that cannot be removed.
These VLANs cannot be deleted unless the switch is in VTP client mode.
These VLANs can only be removed from the switch by using the no vlan 10 and no vlan 100 commands.
Because these VLANs are stored in a file that is called vlan.dat that is located in flash memory, this file must be manually deleted.*

The exhibit shows two PCs called PC A and PC B, two routes called R1 and R2, and two switches. PC A has the address 172.16.1.1/24 and is connected to a switch and into an interface on R1 that has the IP address 172.16.1.254. PC B has the address 172.16.2.1/24 and is connected to a switch that is connected to another interface on R1 with the IP address 172.16.2.254. The serial interface on R1 has the address 172.16.3.1 and is connected to the serial interface on R2 that has the address 172.16.3.2/24. R2 is connected to the internet cloud. Which command will create a static route on R2 in order to reach PC B? 

R2(config)# ip route 172.16.2.1 255.255.255.0 172.16.3.1
R2(config)# ip route 172.16.2.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.2.254

The floating static route command ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 S0/0/1 100 was issued on R1 and now traffic is using the backup link even when the OSPF link is up and functioning. Which change should be made to the static route command so that traffic will only use the OSPF link when it is up??
