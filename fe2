RouterA(config)# router ospf 0

RouterA(config)# router ospf 1*

48. REFER TO THE EXHIBIT.

R1 AND R2 ARE OSPFV3 NEIGHBORS. WHICH ADDRESS WOULD R1 USE AS THE NEXT HOP FOR PACKETS THAT ARE DESTINED FOR THE INTERNET?
FF02::5

2001:DB8:ACAD:1::2

2001:DB8:C5C0:1::2

FE80::21E:BEFF:FEF4:5538*

49. WHAT DOES AN OSPF AREA CONTAIN?
routers that share the same router ID

routers whose SPF trees are identical

routers that have the same link-state information in their LSDBs*

routers that share the same process ID

50. WHAT ARE THE ONLY TWO ROLES THAT PERMIT AN OSPF ROUTER TO BE CONFIGURED FOR SUMMARIZATION? (CHOOSE TWO.)
backbone router

internal router

designated router

area border router*

autonomous system boundary router*

51. WHICH ROUTING TABLE DESCRIPTOR IS USED TO IDENTIFY THE OSPF NETWORKS ADVERTISED BY TYPE 1 LSAS?
O E2

O E1

O IA

O*

52. WHAT ARE TWO FEATURES OF OSPF INTERAREA ROUTE SUMMARIZATION? (CHOOSE TWO.)
ASBRs perform all OSPF summarization.

Routes within an area are summarized by the ABR.*

ABRs advertise the summarized routes into the backbone.*

Type 3 and type 5 LSAs are used to propagate summarized routes by default.

Route summarization results in high network traffic and router overhead.

53. REFER TO THE EXHIBIT.

WHAT ARE THREE RESULTING DR AND BDR ELECTIONS FOR THE GIVEN TOPOLOGY? (CHOOSE THREE.)
R2 is BDR for segment A.*

R4 is BDR for segment B.*

R5 is DR for segment B.*

R1 is DR for segment A.

R3 is DR for segment B.

R3 is DBR for segment B.

54. WHAT IS ONE REASON TO USE THE IP OSPF PRIORITY COMMAND WHEN THE OSPF ROUTING PROTOCOL IS IN USE?
to activate the OSPF neighboring process

to influence the DR/BDR election process*

to provide a backdoor for connectivity during the convergence process

to streamline and speed up the convergence process

55. WHICH STATEMENT DESCRIBES A CHARACTERISTIC OF OSPF EXTERNAL ROUTES?​
The difference between type 1 and type 2 is in the way the cost of the route is being calculated.*

Type 1 and type 2 external routes in IPv4 networks are represented in the routing table by EX1 and EX2, respectively.

A type 2 route is always preferred over a type 1 route for the same destination.

The cost of a type 1 route is always the external cost, regardless of the interior cost to reach that route.

56. REFER TO THE EXHIBIT.

A NETWORK ADMINISTRATOR HAS CONFIGURED OSPFV2 ON THE TWO CISCO ROUTERS AS SHOWN. PC1 IS UNABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH PC2. WHAT SHOULD BE DONE TO FIX THE PROBLEM?
Add the network 192.168.255.2 0.0.0.0 area 0 command to router R1 and remove the network 192.168.255.1 0.0.0.0 area 0 command.

Add the passive-interface S0/0 command to router R1.

Add the network 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 area 0 command to router R1 and remove the network 192.168.10.1 0.0.0.0 area 0 command.

Add the network 192.168.255.0 0.0.0.3 area 0 command to router R1 and remove the network 192.168.255.1 0.0.0.0 area 0 command.*

57. WHICH COMMAND CAN BE USED BY AN ADMINISTRATOR TO DISPLAY A LIST OF INTERFACES THAT ARE ENABLED FOR OSPFV3?

show ipv6 neighbor​

show ipv6 route ospf

58. MATCH THE ORDER IN WHICH THE LINK-STATE ROUTING PROCESS OCCURS ON A ROUTER. (NOT ALL OPTIONS ARE USED.)


Each router learns about its own directly connected networks. => Step 1

Each router is responsible for “saying hello” to its neighbors on directly connected networks. => Step 2

Each router builds a Link-State Packet (LSP) containing the state of each directly connected link => Step 3

Each router floods the LSP to all neighbors, who then store all LSPs received in a database => Step 4

Each router uses the database to construct a complete map of the topology and computes the best => Step 5

59. MATCH THE DESCRIPTION TO THE TERM. (NOT ALL OPTIONS ARE USED.)

Place the options in the following order:

adjacency database => This is where the details of the neighboring routers can be found. 
Shortest Path First => This is the algorithm used by OSPF.
Single-area OSPF => All the routers are in the backbone area.
– not scored – 
link-state database => This is where you can find the topology table.
– not scored –

60. MATCH THE ORDER OF PRECEDENCE TO THE PROCESS LOGIC THAT AN OSPFV3 NETWORK ROUTER GOES THROUGH IN CHOOSING A ROUTER ID. (NOT ALL OPTIONS ARE USED.)


The router displays a console message to configure the router ID manually. => priority 4

The router uses the highest configured IPv4 address of an active interface. => priority 3

The router uses the highest configured IPv4 address of a loopback interface. => prority 2

The router uses the explicitly configured router ID if any. => priority 1
